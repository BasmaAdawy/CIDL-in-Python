    "This section demonstrates a powerful feature of ACO: its adaptability to dynamic changes in the graph. We will simulate the deletion of an edge and then re-run the ACO algorithm. The algorithm can leverage the previously learned pheromone information, potentially leading to faster convergence to a new optimal solution.\n",

    "The original Matlab code used `ginput` for user interaction to select an edge for deletion. In a non-interactive Colab environment, `ginput` cannot be directly used in the same way. For this demonstration, I've hardcoded the deletion of a specific edge (nodes 0 and 1, which corresponds to the first edge defined in `create_graph`) to show the re-optimization process. In a dedicated desktop application, `ginput` or similar event listeners would enable interactive edge selection."

This is in contrast to some other optimization algorithms that might require a full restart from scratch.\n",
